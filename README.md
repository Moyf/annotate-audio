### Options

Each audio-box has its owns. They can be tweaked manually or, more easily, **using the dedicated modal**.
(Their order is not important but they need to be placed before the comments)

| Name          | Default     | Values              | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source`      |             |                     | WikiLink to the audio file to reproduce                                                         |
| `volume`      | `0.5`       | `0.0` → `1.0`       | Player base volume                                                                              |
| `speed`       | `1`         | `0.0` → `1.0`       | Player playback speed                                                                           |
| `loop`        | `false`     | `true`/`false`      | Loop-back to beginning after getting to the end of the audio                                    |
| `sticky`      | `false`     | `true`/`false`      | Main controls become sticky, following you as you scroll down                                   |
| `layout`      | `0`         | `0,1,2`             | What player layout to display (feel free to make your own)                                      |
| `chunk`       | `undefined` | `HH:MM:SS-HH:MM:SS` | Section of audio to play                                                                        |
| `autoplay`    | `false`     | `true`/`false`      | When clicking on a comment, the player starts playing from there instead of simply moving there |
| `unstoppable` | `false`     | `true`/`false`      | When creating/modifing a comment, the player doesn't stop                                       |

There are also some options only available in specific `layout`s

| Layout | Name    | Default     | Values | Description                                                                                               |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | `title` | `undefined` |        | Title of the player. If not present: not shown. If not set: name of audio file (or its alias, if present) |

### Obsidian Commands

| Name              | Action                                                 |

## Development

For all the changes, check [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/12-VidE/annotate-audio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### Road-Map

1. Add i18n support
2. Follow native folder exclusion in the audio file search
3. Render markdown even when modifying a comment (https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-cm6-attributes)

### Known Issues

-   Remove `editMode` flag as it's redundant
-   Better propagate the instruction to use cached values FROM "ParentApp" TO layouts
-   `title` option inside modal is not displayed correctly on mobile
-   Cache the total duration of the file
-   Write new options only on unload (preventing pointless re-renders)
